Please include the following details:
a. The title of your site

Durian

b. Describe what your website does

Multi API job search platform for software engineers

c. List the features you implemented and explain why you chose those

Both JOOBLE and USA_JOBS APIs are simultaneously searchable for software engineer jobs using durian. I sought to congregate job search platforms into one place. Of the available APIs, these two both fit the requisite needs of having the data sets necessary and not being paywalled.

features to implement

If I can get my hands on more job search APIs that are free, actually have job-seeker facing endpoints, and aren't prepetually down (looking at you graphql jobs), I would be thrilled to add more APIs to the search.

d. Where your tests are and how to run them

Tests are included in the react app folder, and can be run using jest.

e. Walk someone through the standard user flow for the website

User visits site; user enjoys the dark theme. User searches for a job based on location or key word. Optionally, user creates an account to save jobs or favorite companies.

f. API information:

This project uses the <a href="https://developer.usajobs.gov/">USA Jobs API</a> as well as the <a href= "https://jooble.org/api/about?ref=apilist.fun">Jooble API</a>

g. Identify the technology stack used to create your website

Durian uses a PERN stack (postgres, express, react, node)

h. Include anything else that you feel is important to share

While initially I was excited to add as many APIs as possible to the project, I quickly came to learn just how many job search APIs are either defunct, enterprise/employer facing, or exorbitantly paywalled away from being utilized in a useful way.

Though this was discouraging, I still managed to find a couple of APIs that value user experience over profit.

Also, the durian on the splash page is from Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.
